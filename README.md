## 👋 Hi there! Welcome!

I'm Anderson Alves, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a Senior Software Developer at IBM.
With over 8 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.

## 🚀 Expertise
Passionate about crafting interactive and intuitive user experiences, I specialize in front-end web development, combining modern frameworks with best practice design patterns. With almost 7 years dedicated to honing my skills in front-end technologies, I've led teams, designed system guidelines, and upheld the highest standards in web performance and SEO.

In my professional journey, I've proudly served as a Front-end Technical Lead as well, a role where my technical expertise met the challenges of team management. Beyond crafting top-tier user interfaces, I embraced the responsibilities of leadership, guiding my team with strategic oversight, and ensuring projects were executed efficiently.
